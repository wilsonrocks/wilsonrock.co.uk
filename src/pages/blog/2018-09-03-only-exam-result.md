# The only exam result I am proud of after eight years of teaching Maths

It's a GCSE result. The student got a B. I'm pretty sure his target was an A.

The class were working at the C/D borderline, a high pressure situation in any school. In a selective school that usually got 100% A*-Cs in Maths, getting a D was viewed as if you'd just live streamed yourself shooting a puppy in the head (partly because your school's ranking would tank down below all of the schools with 100%, rather than then being ordered by whatever the next criteria was).

This boy (I will call him Albert for confidentiality's sake) had a difficult home life. His alarm clock was the school office ringing him every day to come to school. He had long hair, and the other children called him a stoner constantly (there was _some_ evidence to support this), but he was a good egg.

When I took over a Year 10 class, in my first year of teaching, I gave him a sanction for not doing his homework and the rest of the class laughed.

"Sir," one helpful student asked, "Albert has _never_ done his homework!"

Full of vim from my teacher training, I replied something of the lines of "Well, he will now". As it turned out, in the following two years, I got him to do some homework exactly once, and this was viewed in the staffroom as quite the achievement.

The poor kid was clever, but had no support at home, and sadly, in my inexperience, I wasn't very good at managing the behaviour in this class, and I don't think he got a very good deal out of the lessons either.

After speaking with the head of Maths, it became clear that following the normal homework sanctions wouldn't help. Eventually, under the system the school used, he would be put in isolation and even excluded for a few days - meaning he wouldn't do _any_ Maths, rather than just doing some. So, I decided that I'd give him the minor sanctions: breaktime detentions where he could do his homework, and write in the planner his mother was supposed to sign, and conveniently forget to submit the paperwork that would have escalated his punishment to the next level.

I was so proud when Albert got his B. He hadn't appeared to be working _that_ hard, but given his starting point and home support, it was a great achievement. It also felt narratively satisfying - everybody wants to be part of an underdog story.

As a coda to this story, however, I saw him in the supermarket at a later date. He remembered me, and after some diverting chat about thrash metal, I asked him 'what are you doing these days?', expecting, in keeping with the underdog trope, for him to reply that he was a small business owner, an artist, a bank manager, or a human rights campaigner.

"Well, nothing really," he replied.
