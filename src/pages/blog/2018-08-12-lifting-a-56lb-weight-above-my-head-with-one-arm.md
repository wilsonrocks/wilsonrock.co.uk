As I start my career into coding, I'm leaving behind one in education. Eight years as a maths teacher, and three as a local union rep. I've seen a lot of bad stuff, particularly as a union rep, but that can be a matter for another post.

In this series, I'd like to talk about the good memories. It's interesting how many of them are about people, rather than meeting targets, exam results or observations.

The first is this:

# Lifting a 56lb weight above my head from the floor with one arm

I got married a few years ago, and perhaps related to this, I'd started going to the gym a lot. I liked lifting weights, which was a shock to someone who'd spent a lot of his teenage years playing X-Wing.

One of my friends, the head of Electronics had thrown open a challenge to his form and to staff. That was to lift an old school 56lb iron weight above your head in one motion from the floor. Although it had a ring on, this was not a trendy kettlebell. It was the sort of thing you might remember from school.

I tried a number of times throughout the year, but wasn't strong enough.

The last day of the school year approached. It was now or never. A number of us had Friday afternoon off, due to exam classes having left. In half an hour, there would be wine and speeches for the people who were leaving. This was it.

I succeeded.

I also injured my shoulder, which was frowned upon by my fiancee, as we were wedding 9 days later. However, there was only minor pain by this point, hardly noticeable amongst the traditional bridegroom nerves.
