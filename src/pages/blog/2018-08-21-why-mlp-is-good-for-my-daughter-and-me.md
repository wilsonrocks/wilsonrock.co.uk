When I learned what [brony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_fandom) _means_, I didn't think there was any chance that I'd ever be close to being able to be accused of being one.

Netflix Parenting is when you're so tired that putting something on the tv for your children to watch seems like a good idea. Because the next episode autoplays, if the child is engaged, you can get on with having a cup of tea, or tidying the room. Other streaming services are available.

After a bout of Netflix Parenting, I found myself watching My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic with my daughter. At first, I was skeptical. Why are the giant bears not that much bigger than a pony? Why are they ruled by an unelected princess? (this still bothers me, and will likely be the subject of future ~~rants~~ posts)

But, as I watched a few more episodes, I noticed something. The series has a high level of what I call 'wiki-ability,' although I'd love to know the proper name for it.

Wiki-ability in my mind is a measure of how internally diverse and consistent something is. Fantasy and Science fiction universes are full of it. It's a compination of avoiding continuity errors, but having references to other places that are later followed up. Star Wars and Star Trek are classic examples, and, like MLP, have the kind of fandoms that will create the wikis. (as well as complain if things are inconsistent)

Most programmes aimed at 2 to 3 year olds don't have this stuff. If you watch an episode of Paw Patrol, which if you currently have small children, you may be forced to do, there isn't much of a universe. It's like the world stops a few miles outside of Adventure Bay and Foggy Bottom. (this is far from the only problem with Paw Patrol's universe, by the way - personal theory coming in a future blog post!) There's a problem, possibly involving someone who's never been seen before, but the pups solve it, and then it's done. There's no offhand references to other continents that are followed up in future episodes, no introducing of a foreign character and Marshall having to visit their homeland a season later.

So, I like MLP's wiki-ability for the same reason I get drawn into novels with dragons on the cover and maps at the front. It also encourages 'What If' or 'Why' questions for children, which is good - my daughter and I have debated:

* Why Celestia and Luna have bigger horns than the other alicorn princesses - this is still a mystery to me, even with semi-regular googling.
* Whether Tempest Shadow and Capper are nice or nasty - characters who change over time help children to understand morality is complicated - contrast to Paw Patrol's Mayor Humdinger who is just _never_ trustworthy (yet everyone always trusts him at first).
* The intricacies of Discord and Fluttershy's relationship (my fan theory - Discord will marry Pinkie Pie - chaos marriage!)

So it is well made. But I'm also pleased my daughter likes it because I think it is more progressive than most other children's programmes that I've seen (and I've seen more of them than I'd like to). It features female characters who are in leadership roles _without it being a thing that they are female_. One of the most popular ponies, Rainbow Dash, combines being sporty, confident (she has a song called [Time To Be Awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsv-6wfqyg) which my daughter _loves_) but also with a love of books - the characters, while they tend to embody one thing, are about more than that thing.

I like that there are often episodes where they have to save the world from monsters and dark powers, because those are great stories, but there are also stories about people falling out with their friends, about people trying to fix broken friendships and failing, and about people realising they are wrong and apologising. Those are important things for a three year old to see, because one of their biggest worries is their friends being mean to them.

Is there anything I don't like? Well, I'm not keen on the whole "TV show to sell toys" dynamic, and the toys are _really_ expensive, and very similar, and it's not nice to say "no, we can't afford it" in the supermarket when you're both hungry and she sees a Pinkie Pie figure for Â£15. However, owning some of those toys means that we did make this together:

Which was a lot of fun - and also an opportunity to start learning about probability if you roll a die to see which pony moves.

So, overall, there are far far worse things for your children to be binge watching than My Little Pony. 

P.S. Don't be tempted to watch some of the older MLP series on Netflix, they are _awful_.
