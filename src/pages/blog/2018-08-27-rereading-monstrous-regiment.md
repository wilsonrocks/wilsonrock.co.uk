***SPOILER WARNING*** This post contains plot points for the book Monstrous Regiment!

I've been a fan of Terry Pratchett for a long time. My dad (also called Terry) liked the books, and when I was little, I used to hear him laughing. Mum and I called them his 'chuckle books'. One day, he bought me _Wings_ as a present(or it may have been _Only You Can Save Mankind_ - I'm not sure) and I liked it, although I didn't understand a lot of the references or jokes.

Dad had a lot of the discworld books, his favourites being the ones with witches in, his least favourite being any with Rincewind in. I'd receive one every so often as a present. The ones I had as a child were: Diggers, Wings, The Carpet People, Moving Pictures, Interesting Times, Men at Arms, Feet of Clay, and I think I bought myself The Last Continent with some birthday money. I used to read and reread these in particular, and regularly borrow others from him.

He used to read each one twice before passing it to me to read. I remember feeling frustrated if he had a gap between the two re-readings. My dad died while still reading Carpe Juggulum. Terry Pratchett would have made the previous sentence far more amusing. It felt strange to start reading it myself, but

1. He would have wanted me to
2. I really wanted to

After he died, which was when I was fifteen, I pretty much bought each new book, in hardback, as soon as it was released, and that carried on until Terry Pratchett died. I've liked them all, pretty much, although at the time, and on my first reread, I wasn't keen on _Monstrous Regiment_. Recently, I reread it, a task made easier in electronic format, because I could view it on my phone with a sleeping baby on top of me.

I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed it. It's different from the other Discworld books, it has a different vibe. It's more solemn, sadder in a way. Pratchett has never shied away from showing the futility of war, and the violency of poverty, but in this particular story, it's a central theme. It's also interesting, because although Commander Vimes, William de Worde and Otto Chriek all make an appearance, it stands alone in terms of main characters, and location. Borogravia is hardly mentioned (if at all) elsewhere in the canon. The relationship between the main characters and Nuggan and the Duchess is also quite haunting and unusual in Discworld books.

On my first reading, my main criticism of the book, was that one of the key plot elements, that of young women pretending to be men to go to war for a variety of reasons was reused too many times. I have softened a lot on this. I still think it's a valid criticism, but I no longer think that it detracts from the novel.

I think one of the reasons that I like it more now, is that I'm more interested in gender than I was then. (about 10 years ago) It's in the news, for one thing. The 'debates' in the news about gender, which are mainly about whether trans people are people and thus should be allowed to do things like go to the toilet, are not really relevant to this story. Polly does not have gender dysphoria, she's in disguise. 

The story highlights a number of issues around gender stereotypes, some more effectively than others - the 'A woman always has half an onion left when cooking' idea doesn't really shine.

As is often the case in Pratchett's writing, the main message behind the novel, whether he intended to put one in or was just telling a story, seems to be:

> Things won't get better until people think for themselves, and even then it will be hard work for things to get better.

which it is hard to argue with.
