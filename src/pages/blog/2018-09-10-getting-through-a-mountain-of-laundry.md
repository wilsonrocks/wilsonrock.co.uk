Most people have experienced the feeling of 'Everything needs washing, drying or ironing, and I've got nothing to wear today'.

I've come up with a system of dealing with this that works *for me*.

## My Situation:
* a household of four, two of whom are small children
* one baby in washable nappies, which need to be washed separately (because of a higher temperature, not squeamishness about the poo!)
* a fairly large capacity washing machine
* a very small washing line, but highly unreliable weather regarding rain (we are in the shadow of the Pennines)

## What to do

### Do laundry only once a day but do it *every* day
In my case, I actually do it twice a day, because of the nappies, but assuming that you don't have to do that, just do it once a day.

Thoughts like "It's a sunny weekend when I haven't got much else on, I'll do loads and get caught up" are tempting, but should be avoided. You might do a big load of washing, but have you got the time to do a lot of hanging out of wet washing? Have you got time to do lots of folding clothes and putting them away? It's disheartening to be surrounded by wet laundry you don't have space to dry, or make piles of clean dry clothes, that gradually fall over and get dirty because you're too busy to sort them out.

The key is to constantly decrease the amount of laundry you have to do, quicker than the speed at which you are increasing it by wearing clothes. I have found that doing large amounts of laundry in one day leads to skipping future days and coming out with an average of less than one load per day.

### Wash two complete outfits for everyone in the household

I find this to be far more effective than doing "all the T-shirts" or "all the underwear". It takes a little longer when selecting what to wash, and when folding and putting away. But it means that, if you do laundry every day, that you are gaining an extra clean outfit in your wardrobe/drawers *every single day*.

In an extreme situation, it means that in the time it takes to dry one load of washing (24 hours in our spare room with the dehumidifier on) that you have two days' worth of clothes for _everyone_. Given that a huge laundry backlog often means you are in a "no clean pants" situation, this is a huge boost.

In my washing machine, this leaves enough space for my next tip:

### Also wash some stuff you don't wear every day

Things like towels, tablecloths, coats, smart outfits. You don't want to run out of these, but it's not vital that they're done at any particular time. Over the days, they will gradually get done, and your baskets will empty, and you will feel in control of your laundry, like the grownup people suspect you are.

### Don't get disheartened when it looks like you aren't making progress

When you put a large amount of washing in a basket it compresses the lower down laundry. This means that it can look like you haven't made any difference by doing a load of laundry, because all you've done is make the laundry slightly less compressed. *But you have!* If you've followed the first rule, you *know* this.

If your basket flares out upwards as well, this can have an effect as the pile is slower to decrease in height at the top. Remember it's Pi r *squared*!

### Don't give up if you miss a day

If you're making progress every day, then even missing the odd day, you will still make progress over all - as long as you don't miss more days than you wash on.
